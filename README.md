# Zenjob Coding Challenge

This is a **coding challenge** intended for **frontend engineers**. It holds **three different tasks**. For finishing Tasks A and B with some brief documentation, you should not need to invest more than **2 hours** depending on your familiarity with the tech stack and your skills. 

## What this is about

This repository consists of a simplified version of a **ticketing system** like it could be used by Zenjob to handle customer requests. We would like you to extend the functionality of it and ensure it can be used across devices.

### No bootstrapping needed

To allow you to dive right into it, there is a simplified version which already contains the following features:

- an endpoint to list all **people**
- an endpoint to list all **tickets**
- an endpoint to delete **tickets**
- a UI to list all **tickets**

Feel free to adjust the exiting code as much as you like.

For your convenience the repo contains additionally to the UI also the API as well as a local DB. You can play with it as much as you like and re-seed the app whenever needed. To get started just follow the steps in the next section.

### Getting started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then seed the database:

```bash
yarn seed
```

Now you can start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

#### API endpoints

`GET /api/tickets` - get all tickets
`DELETE /api/tickets/:ticketId` - delete a ticket with id = ticketId
`GET /api/users` - get all users

### Specifications

There are certain specifications defined which **must** be met. If you should encounter some shortcomings of the existing system this would need to be corrected.

- the UI should follow the [given designs](https://www.figma.com/file/XRLLHLtNSgEKSQGE4kaFQ9/Front-end-Task?node-id=0%3A1)
- the UI should use the Material-UI component library

## Objective

Your job is to extend the existing UI so it satisfies the following requirements. For more details please see the [attached designs](https://www.figma.com/file/XRLLHLtNSgEKSQGE4kaFQ9/Front-end-Task?node-id=0%3A1). If you have any questions feel free to ask at any time.

### Task A

**AS** a User
I want to be able to delete tasks.

### Task B

**AS** a User
I want to be able to manage the tasks on all my devices.

### Stretch goal

So far this poor repo has no tests. If you feel pumped about it let us see how you would setup testing is this environment and show us an example test.
